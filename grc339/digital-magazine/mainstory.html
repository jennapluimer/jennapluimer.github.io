                                <p>The story of Hampton Water Rosé is as fascinating as the wine itself. Founded by two visionaries with a passion for winemaking and the Hamptons' serene lifestyle, Jon Bon Jovi, the legendary rock icon, and Jesse Bongiovi, his son, embarked on a quest to create the perfect rosé.

They aimed to craft a rosé that embodied the essence of the Hamptons' carefree elegance and the spirit of their family gatherings. Together, they collaborated with renowned winemaker Gérard Bertrand, who brought his extensive knowledge of the Languedoc region in Southern France to the project. This unique partnership birthed a wine that beautifully captures the spirit of the Hamptons' high-society charm and leisurely summer days.</p>
