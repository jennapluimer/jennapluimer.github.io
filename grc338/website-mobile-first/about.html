      <h2>about us</h2>
      <h3>What is Grounders?</h3>
      <p>We are a sports themed coffee shop emblematic of a sports bar, but with the more welcoming and chill environment associated with your run-of-the-mill coffee shop.</p>
      <p> Want to watch the game without the overly loud crowds? We're the place for you!</p>

      <h3>What makes us different?</h3>
      <p>We aren't your typical prime-time only sports bar. We provide our customers with quality coffee and quality streaming of live sporting events. Any time of day, you can find our customers enjoying a cappuccino brewed from on of our single-origin blends while catching up on the latest ESPN broadcast, NFL highlights, and of course broadcasted games of all varieties.</p>
      <p>In our cafes, our goal is that you feel welcomed, seen, and heard, and that whatever coffee you choose fits what you’re looking for. It’s the service at the very end that completes the supply chain. There’s an art to it. We want our cafes to be full of people from our community working, reading, and having conversations all while being surrounded by the ever-so-loved world of sports.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re a coffee professional or you’re just getting started, you can trust that excellence and hospitality run through the core of every part of our business. Join the team.</p>
