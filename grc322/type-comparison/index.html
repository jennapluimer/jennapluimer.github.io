			 <h3 class="franklin">Franklin Gothic</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Franklin Gothic was designed in 1904 by Morris Fuller Benton for the American Type Founders company. The name was inspired by Benjamin Franklin, whom Benton admired for his contributions to American printing history. It is used for titles and bold headings.</p>
             
			 <h3 class="trade">Trade Gothic</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Trade Gothic was designed 1948 by Jackson Burke through Linotype. The grotesque sans-serif typeface was a classic font in books, magazines, and newspapers and used particularly for headlines and classified advertising. It is also commonly used as a secondary typeface. In 2009, Akira Kobayashi updated the font in modern digital standards to create Trade Gothic Next.</p>
