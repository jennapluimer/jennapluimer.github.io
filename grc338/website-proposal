            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Grounders</p>
            
            <p>Grounders is a sports-based coffee shop emblematic of a sports-bar, but with a more welcoming and generally more chill environment. In addition to the different environment, this type of sports hang out would be accessible all day for a variety of sports, not just for the typical primetime games.</p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Generally speaking, Grounders serves the coffee and sports communities. There is a large portion of sports-watchers that don’t necessarily want to be surrounded by the hustle and bustle of sports bars, or even attending watch parties in someone’s home. </p> 
           
            <p>Grounders would still function as a fun, themed-coffee shop that would attract all coffee and coffee shop lovers. This coffee shop would allow all sorts of sports lovers to watch what they wanted to watch in a more comfortable and easy-going environment. </p>
